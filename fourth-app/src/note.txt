*** Lists ***
we can build collection of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.
 
*** Iteration using map method ****

map(callback(currentvalue,index,array),thisArg);
ex.
map((num,index)=>{
    return num;
})

// const arr = [10,20,30,40];

// using Array map method
const newArr = arr.map( num  =>  <li> {num * 2} </li> )


****** Embading map in jsx *******
whenever we want to write javascript inside JSX we need to put {}


*** how to use props with map method ***
same as we pass atrribute we pass its value as array in curly braces.

**** states with map ***
state is basically object. if we have any array as a value then we use map method in them.


***** Key *******
A Key is a special atrribute you need to include when you are creating list of elements.
key helps react identifying which items have changed, updated,removed.
key should be given to elements inside the array to give the element a stable identity.
the best key is a string value.

keys should be unique in one array and its sibling
it might be same in two different array and its sibling that is ok.

if you need the same value (keys value) as props then you need to give differ name to that props and pass it explicitly.


ex.
const arr = [10,20,30];

const newArr = arr.map((num)=>{
    return <li key={num}>{num * 2}
    </li>
})

// index value as a key value is not recommanding
const newArr = arr.map((num,index)=>{
    return <li key={index}>{num * 2}
    </li>
})


basically key is written when we are rendering map function.
key is not passed as props in component.
